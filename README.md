This is a collection of:
  1) tools - personal utilities (sometimes half-brained)
        I have a number of utilities sitting in a private repo that I plan on importing here.  Now it's a matter of finding the time to sanity the code for all eyes (and more importantly, bots) to safely consume.  More to come as time permits
  2) code-practice - randomly written methods used to learn existing/new languages.

As with all of my code, I'm always looking for ways to improve.  If anyone sees a chunk of code that is profoundly suboptimal, please don't hesitate to suggest ways to improve it.

One day, I'll get there...where ever "there" is...
