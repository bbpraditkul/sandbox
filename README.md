This is a collection of:

1) <b>tools</b> - personal utilities (sometimes half-brained)

I have a number of utilities waiting in a private repo that I plan on importing here soon.  It's a matter of finding the time to sanitize the code for all eyes (and more importantly, bots) to safely consume.  More to come as time permits

2) <b>code-practice</b> - randomly written methods used to learn existing/new languages.

As with all of my code, I'm always looking for ways to improve.  If anyone sees a chunk of code that is profoundly suboptimal, please don't hesitate to suggest ways to improve it.

One day, I'll get there...where ever "there" is...
